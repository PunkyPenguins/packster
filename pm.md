commands :
- package pack - create a package
given a package source directory path ( fail if path does not exists or is not a directory )
given a destination path
reads packster-manifest.toml ( fail if file not exists or parsing fail )
create local location and merge pack-location IF ANY
execute "any" and pack handlers with an executor ( powershell by example ) IF ANY
create an archive of the directory in a tmp path
compute a checksum
move to path & rename archive with checksum in filename
delete local location

- package install-file
given package file path ( fail if path does not exists or is not a directory )
given a profil id
given arbitrary json-compliant key/value parameters
verifies file checksum
create packster-deployment.json in temporary directory
compute deployment hash from parameter file hash + package checksum
check there is no other deployment with the same hash ( or exit 0 ) ( or --force then removes the directory )
unpacks file in { location deployment path } / { deployment hash }
move packster-deployment.json to { location deployment path } / { deployment hash }
reads packster-location.json
reads packster-manifest.toml
verify that no other package provides the same resources ( or fail and rollback )
merge install-bundle to given location bundle if any IF ANY
update packages and resources in lockfile in { location deployment path } / packster-location.json


- bundle install
- bundle delete
- location enable
- upgrade
- uninstall
- pin
- locate
- location create
- location setup
    create in a default User Directory

do not need to be installed, just a single binary stuff, writing config in AppData or home directory or current directory as fallback
multiple installed version of the same package by design
a default distribution for a given package
user isolation
manage access rights
semver constraints / range ( adapter flexible to other versionning systems )
service / port isolation ?
integrable with artifactory
multiplatform
multi-languages
create pre-install bomb
supports bundling
package parameters
signing check
integrity check
secfirst
handle build dependencies
testing
cleanup
os constraint ( windows / linux / mac + version )
hardware constraints ( bitness )
supports any scripting language
support content based cache
PATH mgmt / location switching support ( location sets with shims / symlinks)
multi-sources
pinning
CI friendly
licensing + constraints
multi-param packages
pattern locator
guard for unique system resources ( env keys by example : if the same key is used or write by differente package, block it )
always keep consistent, predictable system state

deploy everyting :
- libraries
- cli
- guis
- binaries

hooks :
- packaging
- install
- upgrade
- uninstall
- always ( execute with an argument )


source :
    - MAY contains packages
    - MUST have searching, listing and retrieving capabilites
package :
    - MUST have a filename as : {id}-{semver}-{hash}.packster
    - MUST be a archive file
    - MUST have a unique identifier
    - MUST have a strict semver or "latest"
    - MUST have an integrity hash
    - MAY have a location to merge with the one their installed in
    - MAY have handlers for pack, install, upgrade, uninstall, any
    - MAY have a locator
    - MAY define shims
    - MAY define what it provides ( environment variables keys, shims, shared directory, shared file, network port )
deployment :
    - specific instance of an package
    - MUST be installed to comply to one or many semver constraint within a given location
    - MUST be identified by an integrity hash
bundle :
    - MAY have a set of semver constraints
    - MAY contains parameters for packages
location :
    locations could be stored in ENVIRONMENT for discovery, with just a path to the location deployment
    - installed bundle
    - can extend its bundle by merging other bundles d√©finitions inside
    - MUST have a id and a hash
    - MUST have a unique path where to store deployments
    - MUST have a lockfile
    - MIGHT be set as system ( can fail if there is resources conflicts )
    - MIGHT be loaded just for the shell
    - MAY have shims
