# Packster

Multi-plateform deterministic and unobstrusive System Package Manager

## Goal

This project aim to provide a System-level Package Manager that deal with dependencies in a healthy, deterministic way.

The idea is to use concepts from Language Package Managers ( like cargo ) to handle properly the diamond dependency problem : basically allow multiple versions to be deployed.
